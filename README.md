# javafx8-minesweeper

The primary JavaFX game file is Minesweeper.java. The console window version is run using ConsoleDriver.java, but essentially uses the same core files to run. I had made the project using the Eclipse Neon IDE.

Note that this project was committed here directly from Eclipse Neon, and I did not do .gitignore on some of the extra files that aren't needed if you're not using Eclipse. As such, the tarball `javafx8-minesweeper-src.tar.gz` has been included in the repo of this project, and it contains all of the source files (`.java` files); however, the tarball doesn't have all the files necessary to build.

See [this repo](https://github.com/kurushiidrive/javafx8-minesweeper_executable) for how to build the project.
